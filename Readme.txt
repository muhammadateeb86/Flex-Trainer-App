ðŸš€ Flex Trainer Code and Database Design ðŸš€

I'm excited to share the comprehensive code and database schema for the Flex Trainer project, built using C# with .NET Framework. This project includes:

ðŸ”¹ Member, Trainer, Gym Owner, and Admin Management: Streamlines user registration, login, and profile management.
ðŸ”¹ Workout and Diet Plans: Allows personalized workout and diet plan creation and assignment.
ðŸ”¹ Appointments and Feedback: Facilitates scheduling of training sessions and collection of feedback.
ðŸ”¹ Audit Trail and Triggers: Ensures accountability and tracking of key actions within the system.

This project automates and optimizes gym management processes, enhancing the overall fitness experience.
Its just a desktop application u need to create tables and link that with this code. It would give you an idea.
